# selenium-flex-demo
selenium flex demo project is for flex ui automation using selenium, automation is based on sfapi.swc library, refer to https://code.google.com/p/sfapi/ for more details.

I have bundled sample flex app provided by sfapi team, into a war file which you can copy in tomcat/webapps folder. Start tomcat and check if you can see the flex ui.

Run the test using `mvn clean install -Pui-test`
