# selenium-flex-demo
selenium flex demo project is for flex ui automation using selenium, automation is based on sfapi.swc library, refer to https://code.google.com/p/sfapi/ for more details.

I have bundled sample flex app provided by sfapi team, into a .war file which you can copy in your tomcat/webapps folder. Start tomcat and check if you can see the flex ui by launching URL.

# Run your test
Run the test using `mvn clean install -Pui-test`

TestNG has been used as a test framework.

# TODO
* Adding Timer class for flex objects waiting time to load.
* Restructuring TestNG test
* Adding more test for Grid
